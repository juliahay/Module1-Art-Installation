# Art Installation!

This code is for a generative art installation using a ESP32 with a TTGO T-Dispaly. It was made for Professor Mark Santolucito's Creative Embedded Systems Course. Made in February 2024.

The goal of this art installation is to create randomly generated "courtroom drama" scripts as made from a selection of different stereotypical lawyer phrases.
